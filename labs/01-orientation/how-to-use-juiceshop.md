# How to Use OWASP Juice Shop

This lab orients you to the Juice Shop interface and how challenges are structured.

## Navigation basics

- Explore the shop pages like a normal user.
- Use the menu to access account, products, and information pages.
- The Score Board shows your progress and unlocked challenges.

## How challenges work

- Challenges are triggered by discovering weaknesses in the app.
- Some are visible in the Score Board; others are hidden until discovered.
- You are not expected to use exploit payloads in this lab guide.

## Evidence to capture

Record evidence for your private repo:

- Screenshot(s) of the challenge completion screen.
- Short description of what you observed (no step-by-step solution).
- The OWASP Top 10 category you think it relates to.

Keep evidence high-level and avoid spoilers.
